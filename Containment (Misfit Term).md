## Containment (Misfit Term)

**Definition**  
Previously used to describe the regulation of signals in the research body, but later abandoned.  
- Overloaded with external associations that distort the system’s meaning.  
- Common connotations include:  
  - **Authoritarian containment** (e.g., CCP suppression and epistemic closure).  
  - **Therapeutic containment** (suppression of emotion or dysfunction framing).  
  - **Cultural containment** (East Asian “harmony logic,” fusion over clarity).  
- These associations conflicted with the intended function of preserving clarity and freedom to think.

**Why It Was Replaced**  
- **Too static**: suggests a closed container instead of a dynamic, rule-based process.  
- **Too repressive**: implies suppression or denial of signals.  
- **Too fused**: in cultural contexts, implies blending rather than separation.  
- Did not match the system’s principle of **clarity without suppression**.

**Reframed As**  
- Replaced by **[Signal Gating](./signal-gating.md)**.  
  - More technical, dynamic, and precise.  
  - Captures the intended logic of *filtering, modulating, and rerouting* signals.  
  - Distinguishes your system’s regulation from external misuses of the word containment.
