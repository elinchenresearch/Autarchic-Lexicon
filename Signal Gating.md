## Signal Gating

**Definition**  
A dynamic regulation process for filtering, modulating, and rerouting signals in order to preserve clarity and prevent fusion or overload.  
- Replaces the earlier term **Containment**, which was discarded due to authoritarian, therapeutic, and cultural misreadings.  
- Emphasizes a **technical, context-dependent, non-authoritarian** mode of regulation.  
- Distinct from suppression (CCP logic) or fusion (harmony logic).

**Core Properties**  
- **Dynamic, not static**: gates can open, close, or reroute depending on context.  
- **Clarity-preserving**: prevents external signals from contaminating internal structures.  
- **Non-suppressive**: allows signals to move, but in controlled ways.  
- **Context-dependent**: rules shift according to signal type, density, and load.

**Role in the Research Body**  
- **Epistemic Autarchy System**:  
  - Core mechanism in the **6-Layer Cognitive Architecture** → Layer 3 = *Signal Gating*.  
  - Acts as the frontline regulator between **Mental Sovereignty (L2)** and **Signal Routing & Action (L4)**.  
- **Mental Sovereignty**:  
  - Protects against cultural/media triggers (e.g., songs, traditions).  
  - Manages subtle erosions of clarity in warm but manipulative relationships.  
- **Structural Wager**:  
  - Keeps the wager space uncontaminated, ensuring clean emergence conditions.  
- **Lifecycle System**:  
  - Functions as a tool for *signal distortion monitoring*.  
- **Sino-Containment Archetype**:  
  - Differentiates your gating from cultural/authoritarian containment.

**Applications**  
- **Cultural Inputs**: reframes emotionally charged media as *network vibrations* instead of identity fusions.  
- **AI Design**: inspires modules for filtering/rerouting inputs without collapse or blind absorption.  
- **Cross-Cultural Research**: models rule-based bridging without assimilation (e.g., China–West miscommunication).  
- **Context Lattice System**: implicit gating prevents uncontrolled contamination between lattice contexts.
